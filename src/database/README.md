# Firebase Realtime Database

This module ports core pieces of the Realtime Database from the Firebase JS SDK to Rust.

It wires the Database component into the `FirebaseApp`, provides an in-memory backend for quick tests, and talks to a real database over REST for reads, writes, queries and transactions.

Listeners run over the Realtime Database websocket protocol, so `on_value` and the child events see writes made by other clients. Filtered listens are still served by re-running the query when the path changes, and the connection does not yet reconnect on its own.

It includes error handling, configuration options, and integration with Firebase apps.

Coverage: see the [table in the repository README](https://github.com/marcprux/firebase-rs-sdk#coverage), generated from `docs/coverage.toml`.

## Features

- Component registration and shared get_database resolution
- Reference CRUD with auto-ID push and path navigation (parent/root)
- Priority-aware writes plus server value helpers (`server_timestamp`, `increment`) resolved by the server
- Compare-and-set transactions over the REST ETag protocol
- `connect_database_emulator` for the Realtime Database emulator
- Snapshot traversal (child, has_child, size, to_json) and value/child listeners
- Dual backends (in-memory + REST) with unit test coverage, plus emulator-backed integration tests

## Quick Start Example

```rust,no_run
use firebase_rs_sdk::app::*;
use firebase_rs_sdk::database::{*, query as compose_query};
use serde_json::json;

#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Point to the Realtime Database emulator or a database URL.
    let options = FirebaseOptions {
        project_id: Some("demo-project".into()),
        database_url: Some("http://127.0.0.1:9000/?ns=demo".into()),
        ..Default::default()
    };
    let app = initialize_app(options, Some(FirebaseAppSettings::default())).await?;
    let database = get_database(Some(app)).await?;

    let messages = database.reference("/messages")?;
    messages.set(json!({ "greeting": "hello" })).await?;
    let value = messages.get().await?;
    assert_eq!(value, json!({ "greeting": "hello" }));

    let recent = compose_query(
        messages,
        vec![order_by_child("timestamp"), limit_to_last(10)],
    )?;
    let latest = recent.get().await?;
    println!("latest snapshot: {latest}");

    Ok(())
}
```

## WASM Notes

- The module compiles on wasm targets when the `wasm-web` feature is enabled. Web builds attempt to establish a realtime WebSocket and transparently degrade to a long-poll fetch loop when sockets cannot open, reusing the same listener bookkeeping as native builds. `OnDisconnect` operations require an active WebSocket; on the long-poll fallback they are queued locally and executed when `go_offline()` runs, which does not fully replicate server-side disconnect handling.
- Calling `get_database(None)` is not supported on wasm because the default app lookup is asynchronous. Pass an explicit `FirebaseApp` instance instead.
- `go_online`/`go_offline` are currently stubs on wasm (and native) but provide the async surface needed for upcoming realtime work.
