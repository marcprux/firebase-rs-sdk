## Porting Status

- auth 85% `[######### ]`

- Core functionalities: Mostly implemented
- Tests: httpmock-backed unit suite expanded (requires loopback binding when run locally)
- Documentation: Most public functions are documented
- Examples: 4 provided

Based on the current codebase, I’d put parity with the Firebase Auth JS SDK at roughly 85 %. All of the core sign-in flows (email/password, custom token, anonymous, phone, TOTP, passkey), multi-factor resolver/linking, OAuth scaffolding (with PKCE and built-in providers), persistence, and token refresh logic are in place. The remaining  gap is mostly around browser-specific ceremony glue (popup/redirect adapters, conditional UI), advanced admin/tenant tooling, and a handful of higher-level provider conveniences that the JS SDK ships out of the box.


## What's Implemented
- Emulator-verified flows (tests/live_endpoints.rs): password reset, email verification + `reload`, email-link sign-in, custom tokens with claims + `get_id_token_result`, profile/password/email updates with reauthentication and `verify_before_update_email`, `on_id_token_changed`, Google credential sign-in/link/unlink/reauth (`GoogleAuthProvider::credential`), `fetch_sign_in_methods_for_email`, anonymous upgrade via `link_with_email_and_password`, phone sign-in/link, phone MFA enrol/challenge/unenrol (`Auth::multi_factor_resolver`). Fixes: MFA endpoints now use `v2`; IdP reauthentication sends `autoCreate:false` without `idToken` and checks the uid; profile updates keep the current tokens when the backend omits new ones; custom-token sign-in falls back to the token `sub` when `localId` is absent; `User` carries `metadata` and `provider_data`.

- **Auth service core** (`api.rs`, `mod.rs`) provides component registration, `Auth::builder`, and integration with the app provider registry so callers can resolve `Auth` instances.
- **OAuth scaffolding** (`oauth/`) defines `OAuthRequest`, popup/redirect handler traits, provider builders with PKCE support, and redirect persistence hooks alongside native/WASM examples.
- **REST auth flows** (`api.rs`) unify email/password, custom token, anonymous, email link, and IdP exchanges and centralise out-of-band actions for password reset, email verification, and email link delivery.
- **Account management** (`api/account.rs`) surfaces profile/email/password updates, provider link/unlink, reauthentication helpers, and user deletion endpoints via the Auth REST API.
- **Multi-factor support** (`api/core/mfa.rs`, `types.rs`) covers phone, passkey/WebAuthn, and TOTP enrollment and sign-in with resolver utilities, typed challenges, and session helpers.
- **Phone provider utilities** (`phone/`) supply `PhoneAuthProvider`, `PhoneAuthCredential`, and pluggable verifiers that mirror the JS confirmation flows for SMS authentication.
- **Models & credential helpers** (`model.rs`, `types.rs`) expose `User`, `UserCredential`, provider structs, action code types, token metadata, and JSON serialization helpers for credentials.
- **Error handling** (`error.rs`) defines auth-specific error enums, including multi-factor variants, and result aliases used throughout the module.
- **Token management** (`token_manager.rs`, `api/token.rs`, `token_provider.rs`) tracks ID/refresh tokens, calls the Secure Token endpoint, and provides the `AuthTokenProvider` bridge for other services.
- **State persistence** (`persistence/`) offers in-memory and web storage drivers, including `WebStoragePersistence` for WASM builds behind the `wasm-web` feature.
- **Testing coverage** (unit tests under `src/auth`) uses `httpmock` to exercise REST payloads, persistence, and token refresh logic, guarding against regressions.


### Remaining Gaps

1. **Browser ceremony adapters** – Ship first-party popup/redirect bridges (including conditional passkey UI and
   reCAPTCHA/Play Integrity bootstrap) so WASM/browser consumers get turnkey flows.
2. **Tenant & emulator tooling** – Port tenant-aware auth, localization hooks, password-policy/token-revocation/session cookie endpoints,
   and emulator-friendly toggles.
3. **Provider UX polish** – Add higher-level helpers for remaining providers (Apple/Yahoo variations, Apple nonce
   management), credential serialization shortcuts for cross-process replay, and richer redirect persistence utilities.
4. **Testing & docs parity** – Expand browser/resolver test coverage and documentation to mirror the JS SDK guidance.

### Next Steps

1. **Browser bridge crates** – Deliver popup/redirect + conditional UI adapters for WASM targets so OAuth and passkey
   flows operate with minimal consumer glue (including reCAPTCHA/Play Integrity bootstrapping).
2. **Tenant/emulator & policy endpoints** – Surface project configuration, password policy, token revocation, and
   emulator toggles with rustdoc’d APIs and examples, ensuring they interoperate with existing MFA resolvers.
3. **Provider ergonomics** – Finish porting provider helpers (Google/Facebook/etc.), credential serializers, and session
   cookie utilities to reach the JS SDK developer experience across platforms.
4. **Testing/documentation sweep** – Port the remaining JS browser/resolver suites and expand docs to cover advanced
   scenarios (emulators, multi-tenant usage, popup/redirect best practices).
5. **Testing**
    - Translate the remaining JS suites (providers, MFA, browser flows) to Rust, reusing the `httpmock` harness across
      modules.


## Test Porting Roadmap

This section tracks the JavaScript test surface in `packages/auth` and maps it to Rust parity work in `src/auth`. Use it as the master checklist when translating or replacing test suites.

### Inventory by Area
- **Core & API** – `src/api/authentication/*.test.ts`, `src/api/account_management/*.test.ts`, `src/api/index.test.ts`, password-policy and project-config tests, plus `src/core/auth/*.test.ts`, `src/core/strategies/*.test.ts`, and `src/core/util/*.test.ts`.
- **User, Providers, Persistence, MFA** – `src/core/user/*.test.ts`, `src/core/providers/*.test.ts`, `src/core/credentials/*.test.ts`, `src/core/persistence/*.test.ts`, `src/mfa/*.test.ts`, and `src/mfa/assertions/totp.test.ts`.
- **Platform Browser & React Native** – Browser auth, popup/redirect, strategies (`phone`, `popup`, `redirect`), recaptcha suites, message channel, iframe, and persistence tests (`browser`, `indexed_db`, `local_storage`, `session_storage`), plus React Native persistence.
- **Cordova** – Popup redirect `events`, `popup_redirect`, and `utils` tests under `src/platform_cordova/popup_redirect`.
- **Integration & Harness** – Webdriver suites (`anonymous`, `persistence`, `popup`, `redirect`, `compat/firebaseui`), flow tests (`anonymous`, `custom.local`, `email`, `firebaseserverapp`, `hosting_link`, `idp.local`, `oob.local`, `password_policy`, `phone`, `recaptcha_enterprise`, `totp`), helpers, and `scripts/run_node_tests.ts`.

### Porting Strategy
- **Gap Analysis** – For every Rust module, highlight missing unit/integration coverage in `README.md` issue tracker and open follow-up tickets when core functionality is absent (tests should never outrun implementation).
- **Rust Unit Tests First** – Embed `#[cfg(test)]` modules alongside Rust source for pure logic (core util, strategies, models) and mirror JS describe blocks with idiomatic Rust test functions.
- **Mocked REST Validation** – Replace JS REST mocks with Rust HTTP stubs (`httpmock`, `wiremock`) to assert request payloads, error mapping, and token handling for authentication/account endpoints.
- **Persistence & Token Lifecycle** – Port storage and token manager tests using in-memory fakes; add `wasm-bindgen-test` variants behind the `wasm-web` feature to cover local/session storage semantics and multi-tab coordination.
- **Provider & MFA Suites** – Translate credential/provider/MFA tests incrementally as implementations land. Add feature-gated WASM tests for popup/redirect contracts, and define trait-based shims to represent unimplemented platform adapters.
- **Integration Replacement** – Recreate end-to-end flows within Rust integration tests (`tests/` directory) using mocked transport layers. Reserve browser automation for consumer projects; expose hook traits so external harnesses can drive real WebDriver flows.
- **Tooling & Execution** – Consolidate around `cargo test` targets. Introduce scenario-specific test harness crates when orchestration is needed and document feature flags/environment expectations here after each milestone.

### Recent Progress
- Added Rust unit coverage for email/password sign-in and account creation flows (`src/auth/api.rs`) using `httpmock` to emulate Identity Toolkit responses.
- Exercised secure token exchange success and error paths through `refresh_id_token_with_endpoint` tests (`src/auth/api/token.rs`).
- Introduced shared mock/test helpers (`src/test_support/`) so additional modules can reuse Firebase app and HTTP server scaffolding.
- Ported initial account-management flows (`sendPasswordResetEmail`, `sendEmailVerification`, profile updates, re-auth, deletion) with mock-backed Rust tests (`src/auth/api.rs`).
- Extended coverage to provider unlinking and account lookup (`getAccountInfo`) to validate `accounts:update` and `accounts:lookup` interactions against the mock Identity Toolkit server.
- Added assertions for email/password update paths so token refresh and profile mutations mirror the JS test expectations.

### Current Status
- Core auth flows (sign-in/sign-up, password reset, email verification) now execute against configurable Identity Toolkit/Secure Token endpoints with deterministic mocks.
- Account mutation APIs (`accounts:update`, `accounts:delete`) persist refreshed tokens and propagate provider metadata, enabling unlink flows and account lookups to match JS semantics.
- Shared `test_support` fixtures allow any module to spin up isolated Firebase apps and `httpmock` servers, providing a template for the remaining API and core test ports.

### Next Focus
- **Account management completeness** – Port the remaining JS tests covering profile detail reads (`profile.test.ts`), email/password helpers (`email_and_password.test.ts`), and MFA enrollment/step-up flows (`mfa.test.ts`). Fill in any missing Rust helpers (e.g., `accounts:lookup` field parity, MFA endpoints) alongside new unit tests.
- **Authentication endpoints** – Translate the remaining REST suites (`create_auth_uri`, `idp`, `recaptcha`, `token`, `project_config`) by extending the mock server assertions introduced for password and account flows.
- **Core strategies & util** – Begin mapping `src/core/auth/*.test.ts` and `src/core/strategies/*.test.ts` to Rust unit tests, using the new helpers to stub token providers and persistence as needed.
- **Browser/Platform surfaces** – After core coverage stabilises, adapt the mock pattern for browser persistence/recaptcha tests (gated behind `wasm-web`) and outline any required feature flags or stubbed APIs.

Keep this roadmap updated as suites are ported: mark completed migrations, link Rust test modules, and note any design deviations from the JavaScript originals.

## Implemented
- `on_auth_state_changed` follows the JS contract: observers receive `Option<Arc<User>>`, are primed with the current state, fire only when the signed-in uid changes (sign-in, sign-out, delete, persistence sync), and the returned closure really unsubscribes. `User::get_id_token(force_refresh)` refreshes through the owning `Auth` (weak back-reference) when forced or expired; `User::cached_id_token()` exposes the cached value.
- Backend errors are mapped to typed codes: `AuthError::Server(AuthServerError)` exposes an `AuthErrorCode` (`auth/wrong-password`, `auth/user-not-found`, `auth/too-many-requests`, ...) using the JS `SERVER_ERROR_MAP`, plus the raw server code, the ` : ` detail message and the HTTP status. Unmapped codes are normalised the JS way (`CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` becomes `auth/configuration-not-found`). Transport failures stay `AuthError::Network`.
